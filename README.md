# 🧪 North American Copper Market Outlook: 2025–2030  
### Strategic Implications for Rio Tinto

---

## 📌 Overview

This project delivers a strategic, data-driven copper market model tailored to North America, focusing on the evolving demand and supply dynamics from 2025 to 2030. It was developed as a personal contribution in preparation for the **Principal Analyst – Copper Market Analysis** role at **Rio Tinto**.

The model simulates scenarios including baseline growth, accelerated green transition, and supply disruptions. It aims to guide commercial and strategic decision-making through a combination of:

- Supply-demand forecasts  
- Scenario analysis  
- Competitor benchmarking  
- Strategic insights tailored to Rio Tinto’s position in the copper value chain

## 🌎 Why Copper?

Copper plays a critical role in the energy transition — from electric vehicles and solar panels to transmission infrastructure. With demand accelerating and supply growth constrained, understanding regional trends is essential for long-term planning and commercial positioning.
